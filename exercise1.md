The application is coded using Python.  Linting Python is possible with multiple linters. For this application we would choose Pylint as it is easily usable in Visual Studio code. Apparently ptlint is a little bit more throurough than other Python linters. Testing is done with Pytest instead of the build-in Unittest. It has great features for small tests and is also scalable for comlex testing. It also has nice plugins readu to use. For building PyBuilder is chosen since it is mainly targeted for Python ecosystems. 
It looks like Jenkins and GitHub actions really are the fan favourites and many advice on not to change from those if at all possible. However, if you are after new functionalities, it may be that you need an alteernative for Jenkins.  For a free alternative withour limitations on the build time, TeamCity seems like a good choice.  Depending on if the repo is hosted on gitlab, GitLab CI could also be used.
WIth a team of six people I expect the project to be substantial enough to warrant the use of a self-hosted setup. This would require a bigger budget but since release is soon, I expect that budget has been taken care of. However, maintaining the CI environment takes some effort atleast in a self-hosted setup. If the team is downscaling after release, cloud based might be better.
